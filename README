NAME
    GPS::Lowrance::LSI - Lowrance Serial Interface Protocol module in Perl

REQUIREMENTS
    The following modules are required to use this module:

      Carp::Assert
      Parse::Binary::FixedFormat
      Win32::SerialPort or Device::SerialPort

    This module should work with Perl 5.6.x. It has been tested on Perl
    5.8.2.

  Installation
    Installation is standard:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    For Windows playforms, you may need to use "nmake" instead.

SYNOPSIS
      use Win32::SerialPort;                # or Device::SerialPort (?)
      use GPS::Lowrance::LSI 'lsi_query';

      my $port = new Win32::SerialPort( 'com1' );

      my $data = lsi_query( $port, 0x30e, "", 0 );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides *very* low-level support for the LSI (Lowrance
    Serial Interface) 100 protocol used to communicate with Lowrance GPS
    devices.

    (Higher-level functions and wrappers for specific commands will be
    provided in other modules. This module is intentionally kept simple.)

    More information is available in the module documentation.
